# Matsuoka_CPG_snake_robot-Genetic Algorithm
Implementation of Matsuoka CPG for controlling snake robot - parameter optimization using Genetic Algorithm 

All joints trained by fixing  weight first (defining phase and weight value 1.0) and trained for 25 generation using genetic algorithm then after optimising CPG parametrs again for 15 generation weight trained
